## About Project 
Problem statement : The seasonal farming model in our country leaves a large portion of farmlands barren during offseason. 
					There is a dire need of easily accessible information about government initiatives, financial management and resource management within the farmer community.
					
Solution : Our solution includes building a web portal for providing the farmers with easily accessible knowledge about weather and soil conditions, local and national demands of seasonal and off-seasonal crops that can be grown in a particular region using machine learning.
		   Also, information regarding cold storage warehouses and government policies and financial resource management will be assimilated into the portal. 
		   The aim is to provide a simple, multilingual interface for farmers to get access to all information for their welfare and maximal utilization of available resources for the upliftment of the farming community.
